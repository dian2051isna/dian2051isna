### 👋 Hi there, I'm Dian!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
You can just call me **Dian** — an aspiring learner from Indonesia 🇮🇩

💻 I'm currently learning:
- 🐍 **Python** – for scripting, automation, and backend development
- ⚙️ **C#** – exploring .NET for building robust applications
- ⚙️ **Flutter** – exploring user interface for devices application, especially Mobile Apps

🌱 Still a beginner, but:
- Passionate about learning and growing in the tech world
- Believing in progress over perfection
- Open to collaboration, feedback, and new challenges!

📌 Fun fact: I believe every expert was once a beginner — and I'm enjoying every step of this journey.
